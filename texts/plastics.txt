Plastics in waterways are synthetic polymers widely used in consumer and industrial applications due to their durability and low cost. However, plastic pollution has become a global environmental concern in marine and freshwater ecosystems. Plastics enter waterways through direct disposal, land-based sources, and marine activities. Over time, plastics break down into smaller particles known as microplastics, which pose significant threats to aquatic life.
