Recreational fishing has potential impacts on aquatic ecosystems. Issues include overfishing, where catch rates exceed fish populations' ability to replenish, leading to population declines and ecological imbalances. Bycatch, the unintentional capture of non-target species, can harm vulnerable populations and disrupt food chains. Recreational fishing activities like motorized boating and gear use can degrade habitats, compromising fish spawning and nesting grounds. Additionally, the introduction of invasive species through fishing can disrupt ecosystems and harm native species. Pollution from discarded fishing materials exacerbates habitat degradation and poses risks to aquatic life.
