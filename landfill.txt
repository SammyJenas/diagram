Landfills are disposal sites for solid waste, often located near waterways. They pose environmental risks to aquatic ecosystems due to leachate, a toxic liquid formed as waste decomposes. Leachate contains harmful chemicals that can contaminate groundwater and surface water, threatening aquatic life and ecosystem health. Landfills may also emit greenhouse gases like methane, contributing to climate change. Proper landfill management, including liners and leachate collection systems, is essential to prevent water pollution and ecosystem degradation. Additionally, reducing waste through recycling and waste reduction measures helps mitigate the environmental impacts of landfills on waterways and ecosystems.
