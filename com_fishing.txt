Ecological concerns about freshwater commercial fishing center on sustainability and ecosystem health. Overfishing depletes fish populations faster than they can reproduce, disrupting food webs and causing imbalances. Bycatch inadvertently captures non-target species, endangering vulnerable populations and altering ecosystems. Habitat degradation occurs through fishing practices like dredging and trawling, harming essential breeding and feeding areas. Introduction of invasive species disrupts native ecosystems and biodiversity. Pollution from fishing vessels and gear, along with improper waste disposal, threatens freshwater habitats and aquatic life.
