Marine and coastal ecosystems refer to the diverse habitats and environments found in oceans, seas, and coastal areas. They encompass a wide range of ecosystems, including coral reefs, mangrove forests, seagrass beds, rocky shores, sandy beaches, and deep-sea environments.
Marine biodiversity refers to the variety of life forms found in these ecosystems, including microorganisms, algae, invertebrates, fish, marine mammals, and seabirds. These ecosystems support a rich array of species and provide essential ecosystem services, such as food provision, nutrient cycling, climate regulation, coastal protection, and recreational opportunities.
