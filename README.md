# Diagram

This is a prototype of an online interactive diagram for a Terrestrial Assemblages project.

The diagram is viewable as a webpage here: https://sammyjenas.github.io/diagram/

## Terrestrial Assemblages
Terrestrial Assemblages is an arts based ecological working group initiated by Simon Ingram that seeks to create awareness of and sensitivity to natural systems in contemporary art audiences.

## Furher things to consider for the diagram
* API calls to an LLM to generate responses to users' questions.
* Generate text for connections between nodes/buttons on the diagram. Clicking on the connecting lines could print text to the lower section of the diagram.
* Enable the diagram to display properly on different sized devices and browser windows.
* The current txt files were generated using ChatGPT and are intended as placeholders. Further consideration is needed, e.g. should these texts be written by an LLM? Should further prompting and proofing be done?
* Improve the modularity of the code.
* Complete the diagram, i.e. add all the remaining nodes and connecting lines.
